  "readme": "# react-addons-create-fragment\n\n\n>**Note:**\n>This is a legacy React addon, and is no longer maintained.\n>\n>We don't encourage using it in new code, but it exists for backwards compatibility.  \n>The recommended migration path is to use arrays with explicit keys on individual elements.\n\n**Importing**\n\n```javascript\nimport createFragment from 'react-addons-create-fragment'; // ES6\nvar createFragment = require('react-addons-create-fragment'); // ES5 with npm\n```\n\nIf you prefer a `<script>` tag, you can get it from `React.addons.createFragment` with:\n\n```html\n<!-- development version -->\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/react-addons-create-fragment/react-addons-create-fragment.js\"></script>\n\n<!-- production version -->\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/react-addons-create-fragment/react-addons-create-fragment.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nIn this case, make sure to put the `<script>` tag after React.\n\n## Overview\n\nIn most cases, you can use the `key` prop to specify keys on the elements you're returning from `render`. However, this breaks down in one situation: if you have two sets of children that you need to reorder, there's no way to put a key on each set without adding a wrapper element.\n\nThat is, if you have a component such as:\n\n```js\nfunction Swapper(props) {\n  let children;\n  if (props.swapped) {\n    children = [props.rightChildren, props.leftChildren];\n  } else {\n    children = [props.leftChildren, props.rightChildren];\n  }\n  return <div>{children}</div>;\n}\n```\n\nThe children will unmount and remount as you change the `swapped` prop because there aren't any keys marked on the two sets of children.\n\nTo solve this problem, you can use the `createFragment` add-on to give keys to the sets of children.\n\n#### `Array<ReactNode> createFragment(object children)`\n\nInstead of creating arrays, we write:\n\n```javascript\nimport createFragment from 'react-addons-create-fragment';\n\nfunction Swapper(props) {\n  let children;\n  if (props.swapped) {\n    children = createFragment({\n      right: props.rightChildren,\n      left: props.leftChildren\n    });\n  } else {\n    children = createFragment({\n      left: props.leftChildren,\n      right: props.rightChildren\n    });\n  }\n  return <div>{children}</div>;\n}\n```\n\nThe keys of the passed object (that is, `left` and `right`) are used as keys for the entire set of children, and the order of the object's keys is used to determine the order of the rendered children. With this change, the two sets of children will be properly reordered in the DOM without unmounting.\n\nThe return value of `createFragment` should be treated as an opaque object; you can use the [`React.Children`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-api.html#react.children) helpers to loop through a fragment but should not access it directly. Note also that we're relying on the JavaScript engine preserving object enumeration order here, which is not guaranteed by the spec but is implemented by all major browsers and VMs for objects with non-numeric keys.\n",
